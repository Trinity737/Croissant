      What is a Croissant? "Croissants are light, flaky, buttery pastries
      popular in France. A croissant is a type of pastry, classically made with
      puff pastry dough so that it is light, flaky, and extremely buttery.
      Traditionally, croissants are formed into crescent shapes, which is
      probably where the name originated, since croissant means “crescent” in
      French. The pastries are extremely popular in France as well as in other
      nations, and are typically eaten with breakfast. In some cases, croissants
      may also be filled with sweet or savory ingredient, or used like bread to
      make croissant sandwiches." Mary McMahon
