        "Croissants are light, flaky, buttery pastries popular in France. A
        croissant is a type of pastry, classically made with puff pastry dough
        so that it is light, flaky, and extremely buttery. Traditionally,
        croissants are formed into crescent shapes, which is probably where the
        name originated, since croissant means “crescent” in French. The
        pastries are extremely popular in France as well as in other nations,
        and are typically eaten with breakfast. In some cases, croissants may
        also be filled with sweet or savory ingredient, or used like bread to
        make croissant sandwiches." Mary McMahon
